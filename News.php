	<p class="information" >
	Blood consists of a liquid called plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. Red bloods cells deliver 
	oxygen from your lungs to your tissues and organs, white blood cells fight infection as part of your body's defense 
	system, and platelets help blood clot when you experience a cut or wound. Blood is a constantly circulating fluid
	providing the body with nutrition, oxygen, and waste removal. Your blood group depends on which antigens occur 
	on the surface of your red blood cells.

    <h2 style="color:red;">Novel device measures stiffness and stickiness of red blood cells </h2>
	
	<p class="information">
	he team, from Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) in Cleveland, OH, describes the innovative device - a microfluidic platform with a computer algorithm that does the math - in a paper published in the journal Technology.

Sickle cell disease is a group of inherited red blood cell disorders. People with the disease have abnormal hemoglobin - the protein that carries oxygen - in their red blood cells. The abnormal hemoglobin is called sickle hemoglobin.

Red blood cells containing normal hemoglobin are flexible and shaped like a doughnut with a thin flat area in the middle instead of a hole. This allows them to squeeze round bends in blood vessels and through smaller ones to deliver vital oxygen to tissues and organs

    <h2 style="color:red;" >Zika test for donated blood given green light by FDA</h2>
	 
	 <p class="information">
	 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) say in a statement released on Wednesday that:

"The screening test may be used under an investigational new drug application (IND) for screening donated blood in areas with active mosquito-borne transmission of Zika virus."

IND status does not mean that the FDA have cleared or approved the Zika test. It means the federal regulator has authorized its use under a specific protocol by US blood screening laboratories.

As the test is still experimental, all testing laboratories have to be enrolled and contracted into the clinical trial and agree to the terms set out by the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER).
