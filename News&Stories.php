	Most roads have been cleared, and businesses have reopened. 
Tourism - which brings the largest source of revenue to Nepal - is gradually gaining momentum. 
School children are back at school, studying in Temporary Learning Centres (TLC).Losses and damage caused by the devastating earthquakes have been assessed. 
But most of the rubble remains, and the Himalayan nation has yet to officially kick start its reconstruction mission.One year on, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies estimates that “four million people are still living in sub-standard temporary shelters" where they are exposed to weather and health hazards. It also estimates that more than 800,000 homes were damaged.

"Despite achievements in many areas of earthquake recovery efforts, little progress has so far been made in helping survivors to rebuild permanent homes," it said.Five months post-quake, the Singapore Red Cross had identified some 70 community facilities in the most severely affected districts of Dolakha, Dhading, Gorkha, Sindhupalchowk and Khotang to support.

	<p class="information">
With an eye on the future, Singapore Red Cross intends to to leverage the rebuilt community facilities to provide services that strengthen community resilience. These include healthcare, given the high infant mortality rate and chronic malnutrition; education, given the low literacy rate; as well as youth development. It also looks set to engage its youth wing - the Red Cross Youth - for humanitarian programmes in Nepal.
As a gesture of friendship and gratitude, the Nepalese Society in Singapore has organised a blood drive themed “A Community Bonded by Blood” to thank Singaporeans for their warm support in helping to rebuild their homeland.
