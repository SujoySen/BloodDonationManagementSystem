	<h2 style="color:red;" >Why Should I Donate Blood?</h2>
	<p class="information" >
	Blood is needed to save lives in times of emergencies and to sustain the lives of those with medical conditions, like leukemia, thalassaemia and bleeding disorders, as well as patients who are undergoing major surgeries.
    For many patients, blood donors are their lifeline. One unit of blood can save three lives!
    Every hour of the day, 15 units of blood are used in Singapore. More than 100,000 units of blood are needed to meet the transfusion needs of patients every year, equivalent to more than 350 units of blood a day.
    With an ageing population, more advanced life-saving medical procedures, and new hospitals being established, more blood will be needed every year.

    <h2 style="color:red;">Can I Donate Blood?</h2>
	
	<p class="information">
	There are some basic requirements you need to fulfill in order to become a blood donor. You may become a donor if you:
are aged between 16 and 60 (Youths aged 16 and 17 will need to complete and bring a signed parental consent form)
weigh at least 45kg
are in good health
do not have any symptoms of infection (e.g. sore throat, cough, runny nose, diarrhoea) for at least one week
did not have fever in the last three weeks
have a haemoglobin level of at least 12.5g/dl (Tests will be administered by trained nurses at the donation site) Click here for tips on how to bump up your haemoglobin and iron levels.
At the donation site, you will also be asked to complete a Donor Health Assessment Questionnaire. Depending on your answers, you may or may not be eligible to donate blood.
When Not To Donate
You are advised to postpone your blood donation if you’re currently undergoing treatment for a major illness or surgery, or (for women) if you’re pregnant or experiencing heavy menstrual flow.
