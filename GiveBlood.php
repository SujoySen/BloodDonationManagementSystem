	<h2 style="color:red;" >Why Should I Donate Blood?</h2>
	<p class="information" >
	Blood is needed to save lives in times of emergencies and to sustain the lives of those with medical conditions, like leukemia, thalassaemia and bleeding disorders, as well as patients who are undergoing major surgeries.
    For many patients, blood donors are their lifeline. One unit of blood can save three lives!
    Every hour of the day, 15 units of blood are used in Singapore. More than 100,000 units of blood are needed to meet the transfusion needs of patients every year, equivalent to more than 350 units of blood a day.
    With an ageing population, more advanced life-saving medical procedures, and new hospitals being established, more blood will be needed every year.
