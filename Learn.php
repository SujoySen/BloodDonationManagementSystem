        <h2 style="color:red;">First Aid</h2>
	
	<p class="information">
	An accident happens when you least expect it. When someone 
	collapses from a cardiac arrest, you only have four minutes to 
	save his or her life before brain damage occurs. First aid 
	knowledge and skills are indispensable to saving lives in times
	of emergencies, particularly before medical aid arrives. The 
	first aider promotes recovery, provides comfort and relief for
	the casualty and prevents the condition from worsening.
Anyone can learn first aid and everyone should! Learn first aid to 
protect your loved ones, friends, colleagues and even a stranger.
 We have classes covering key areas of first aid training.

	<h2 style="color:red;">Psychosocial Support</h2>
	
	<p class="information">
Apart from destruction and physical hurt, disasters and conflicts impact many
 victims psychologically. Emotional hurt is less visible than material losses 
 but it often takes far longer to recover. Therefore, aside from emergency 
 relief like food, healthcare, water and shelter, it is also imperative to 
 provide psychosocial support. It can be adapted to suit situations and 
 address the needs of the affected people to help them accept reality and 
 cope with it. It helps victims of the disaster heal psychologically and 
 change them into active survivors instead of passive victims.
